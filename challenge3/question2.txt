To make the query run faster, 
we can create indexes on the columns that are we are using frequently on below
WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses.

==>columns to index:

1.  users.id: 
The id column is used to join the users table with other tables, so indexing would increase speed up the joins.

2.  cabs.userId: 
The userId column is used to join the cabs table with the users table, so indexing would increase speed up the joins.

3.  trips.cabId: 
The cabId column is used to join the trips table with the cabs table, so indexing would increase speed up the joins.

3.  trips.driverId: 
The driverId column is used to join the trips table with the driver table, so indexing would increase speed up the joins.
